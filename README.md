# 2048 Game with NFT Marketplace & FHEVM Privacy

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md) | [FHEVM Integration Guide](FHEVM_INTEGRATION.md)

A blockchain-based 2048 game that integrates NFT minting and marketplace functionality, now enhanced with **Zama's FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine)** for complete privacy. Players can mint their game achievements as NFTs and trade them in the marketplace while keeping their scores, balances, and transaction amounts completely confidential.

- **🎮 Private Game Scores**: Your actual scores are encrypted and only you can see them
- **💰 Confidential Token Balances**: Token amounts are hidden from public view
- **🖼️ Encrypted NFT Metadata**: Achievement data in NFTs remains private
- **🛒 Hidden Marketplace Prices**: Trading prices can be kept secret
